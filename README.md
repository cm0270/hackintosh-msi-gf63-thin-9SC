IÂ´ll make an step by step for myself and anyone interested in this.

1. FORMAT USB (Disk-Utility osx) 16GB OR GREATHER.
   Format FAT32 - GUID PARTITION MAP.

2. COPY INSTALLER TO USB(TERMINAL)
   sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/USBINSTALLER/

3. Download Clover_v2.5k_r5104.pkg

4. Install clover in EFI of usb.

6. Install Catalalina.

7. Postintall setup: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-native-power-management-for-laptops.175801/
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0

I am at this point: XCPM only (not so experimental anymore,... it is proven to work)
i tryed with plugin type and got frezes also tryed ssdtPRGen but post says
coffee lake does not need it.

Upload benchmark tests
